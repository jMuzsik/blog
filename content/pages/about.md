This site is a WIP. I have a lot of notes on here that I am consolidating, etc.

I'm Jerry. Born and raised in the Bronx. Before joining the tech world, I was a chef in NYC. Currently, I am (mainly) a web developer. I'm in school currently, pursuing a degree in Biomedical Informatics. Contemplating a more academic life. Contemplating quite a few things. This self, can it ever be completely understood? But I do love to create things with boolean switches. And I love science that touches the metaphysical. I believe that I am looking for an intersection of these two things. With some cooking mixed in.

Some facts perhaps?

- If I have to pick a gender classification, it's guy.
- I read a lot of magazines...[Nautilus](https://nautil.us/), [MIT Technology Review](https://www.technologyreview.com/), and whatever other interesting things I get my hands on. I read a lot in general.
- A defining characteristic? 95% of the people I meet do not believe me when I say I am American
- Sports? I play a lot of football (the one with the ball on the feet). Surfing is fun
- Weekend? Words, experiences, and [Go](https://senseis.xmp.net/?WhatIsGo)
- Why do people not believe you're American? (Predominantly) an inexplicable deep accent
- I don't watch much stuff nowadays but if I did I'd be utilising my [Mubi](https://mubi.com/showing) subscription.
- I tend to go on long walks.

And [this is my resume](https://youthful-shirley-b0ee96.netlify.com/) written in CSS/HTML.
