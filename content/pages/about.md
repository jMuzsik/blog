I'm Jerry. Born and raised in the Bronx. Before joining the tech world, I was a chef in NYC. Currently, I am a Web Developer with a focus on UX and performance. And all the other cool new things. React, Node, and the giant ecosystem around it, which I have consumed a healthy portion of over my time in this field.

I've made some things over time. Like this: [Find an issue](https://findanissue.com/). And a bunch of sites for the company I have been working at: [Meep Labs](https://meeplabs.com/) (including the site). I can do other stuff like integrate products into [Zolando](https://www.zalando.co.uk/women-home/). I like to write technical articles, and my posts can be found on this site or over at [Free Code Camp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/author/jerry/).

Some facts perhaps?

- Favorite magazine? [Nautilus](http://nautil.us/)
- A defining characteristic? 95% of the people I meet do not believe me when I say I am American
- Sports chops? I play a lot of soccer. Surfing is fun
- Weekend? Bar and philosophical/heavy conversations
- Why do people not believe you're American? (Predominantly) an inexplicable deep accent
- Favorite show? Monty Python and the Flying Circus
