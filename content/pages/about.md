I'm Jerry. Born and raised in the Bronx. Before joining the tech world, I was a chef in NYC. Currently, I am a Web Developer with a focus on UX and performance. And all the other cool new things. React, Node, and the giant ecosystem around it, which I have consumed a healthy portion of over my time in this field.

I've made some things over time. Like this: [Find an issue](https://findanissue.com/). And a bunch of sites for the company I have been working at: [Meep Labs](https://meeplabs.com/) (including their site). I can do other stuff like integrate products into [Zolando](https://www.zalando.co.uk/women-home/) or replicate the design of almost any site. I like to write technical articles, and my posts can be found on this site or over at [Free Code Camp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/author/jerry/). Well, eventually they will be. Meanwhile, I am writing almost daily stuff on here.

Some facts perhaps?

- Favorite magazines? [Nautilus](http://nautil.us/) and [MIT Technology Review](https://www.technologyreview.com/)
- A defining characteristic? 95% of the people I meet do not believe me when I say I am American
- Sports? I play a lot of football (the one with the ball on the feet). Surfing is fun
- Weekend? Words, experiences, and [Go](https://senseis.xmp.net/?WhatIsGo)
- Why do people not believe you're American? (Predominantly) an inexplicable deep accent
- Why do you love programming? The incredible amount of possibilities
- Favorite show atm? Monty Python and the Flying Circus
