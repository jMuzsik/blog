## Value Proposition

Your learning must outpace technology change

- So learning is your primary skill

## Learning Styles

You do not learn in one particular way

### Distributed Practice

Spaced out learning is best

### Varied/Interleaved Practice

Frequently change tasks and topics so that you are forced to think about the material in different ways

#### Spaced Repetition

Review before you forget

- Think, how can I incorporate learning into my everyday?

## 30 Second Summary

- On any topic or technology
  - Recite a 15 to 30 second summary
    - Key strengths
    - Key weaknesses
    - How it interacts with other services or features

## Mnemonic

Used to encode information

- Aids original information in becoming associated with something more meaningful for greater retention

## Visualisations

Uses the brain's visuospatial thinking ability

- Leverages human tendency to remember our _experiences_

## PDCA

- Plan
  - what are you going to do to learn some material?
- Do
  - Do what you plan
- Check
  - How well did the plan work?
- Adjust (or Act)
  - Adjust your plan for future learning and act on what you learned

## Feynman Technique

1.  Take a piece of paper and write the concept's name at the top
2.  Explain the topic in simple language
3.  Identify problem areas, then go back to the sources to review
4.  Pinpoint any complicated terms and challenge yourself to simplify them

## Learning Techniques

### Elaborative Interogation (rating = moderate)

- A method involving creating explanations for why stated facts are true. The method involves concentrating on why questions rather than what questions and creating questions for yourself as you are working through a task.

### Self Explanation (rating = moderate)

- A technique that is useful for abstract learning. The technique involves explaining and recording how one solves or understands problems as they work and giving reasons for choices that are made.

### Summarisation (Rating = low)

- An old staple, tested by having participants summarise every page of text in to a few short lines.

### Additional Techniques

1. Highlighting and underlining (Rating = low)
2. The keyword mnemonic (Rating = low)
3. Imagery for Text Learning (Rating = low)
4. Rereading (Rating = low)
5. Practice Testing (Rating = High)
6. Distributed Practice (Rating = High)
7. Interleaved Practice (Rating = Moderate)
