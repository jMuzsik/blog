## Some stuff about life

### Handling the minutieu of tasks

#### Four ways

1. Walk away
   - Sometimes it is not worth the effort. It is not worth the time needed to accomplish the task. This is the simplest way.
2. Do it yourself
   - When we work on a task ourselves we are immersed in it. So, we are immersed in the effort to finish the task, and the accomplishing of the task is associated with all the nuances related to our effort within our mind. Genuine effort is the best trait in this way.
3. Let others do it
   - Often, the finishing of a task can be done by those other than yourself. So, you can decide to take this task into your own hands or allow others to accomplish it. But, when another is working on this task, and we have no control over it being finished the thoughts that we have are generally related to the time it is taking for this person to accomplish this task. Patience is the best trait in this way.
4. Do it together
   - This relates to doing a task with others simultaneously. Teamwork. Patience and effort at the same time. You immerse youreself in the accomplishing of the task and you patiently wait simultaneously.
