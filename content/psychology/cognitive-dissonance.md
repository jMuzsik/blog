## TL;DR

1. Cognitive dissonance is when external stimuli contradictions the predictions in your mind.
2. Test your own CD by defending your personal beliefs.
3. CD is a cause of racial problems.
4. The predictive dissonance model touches neuroscience closely. We are constantly redefining our predictions to better handle external stimuli.
5. CD touches much of the brain in a variety of ways. To truly understand these processes, one must learn the parts of the brain and their functioning.
6. Neuroscience dissonance study showing a word with the name of a color while the word is another color than this color, causing CD in an archaic way. One part of brain was much more active.
7. Understanding neural networks is the next step.

## Cognitive Dissonance

The problem associated with someone having two contradictory trains of thought at the same time.

### Magnitude of Dissonance

It can be assumed that when the reason of one's dissonance is from work or personal relationships (ie. elements which affect us continually) then this dissonance is magnified. The dissonances related to these things will affect our existential sense of being.

If it is something smaller, say the fact that a day is very hot and one must adapt to this. The dissonance is less impactful, it is more so a cognitive struggle, not an existential struggle.

### Reduction

In practice, people reduce the magnitude of their cognitive dissonance in four ways. Let us relate this scenario... you are playing soccer and one player is overly loud, competitive, and loves to tell other players what to do. He is also prone to thoughtless, unkind words. How to handle such a situation:

1. Change the behavior or the cognition ("I will ignore this individual.")
2. Justify the behavior or the cognition, by changing the conflicting cognition ("He is too loud to ignore. Let me try to understand why he is this way.")
3. Justify the behavior or the cognition by adding new cognition's ("He is loud, likely as he grew up in a loud family. In his workplace, he is likely a manager, and the people he works for likely reinforce this behavior.")
4. Ignore or deny information that conflicts with existing beliefs ("I will tell him to shut the fuck up, as kindly as possible.")

#### Cognitive Bias's related to Reduction

1. One believes they do not have biases (? people without opinions perhaps)
2. The bias that one is "better, kinder, smarter, more moral and nicer than average" (trying to define other's behavior with the assumption that you know better?)
3. Confirmation Bias (the impossibility of separating ourselves from external stimuli)

### Paradigms

#### Belief disconfirmation

If, say, one's belief is irrevocably overturned. One will often not give up their idea but come up with a reason why their belief was not proven and turn to a new idea interlocked with the old.

#### Induced Compliance

_Effect of the Severity of Threat on the Devaluation of Forbidden Behavior_

- This study used 2 groups of children and 2 trials for each group. The setting was a room with toys to play with. For the first group, the children were told there would be a _minor punishment_ if they played with a specific toy in the room. The second group were told there would be a _severe punishment_ if they played with this toy. They did not play with it during this trial. For the second trial, there was no punishment to play with the toy.
  - Result: the children who were told there would be a _minor punishment_ were less likely to play with the toy when there was no punishment involved because in the initial trial there was more mental effort to convince their selves to not play with the toy. It was a simple decision for the _severe punishment_ children.

### Applications

#### Education

A basic way to help students see their cognitive dissonance is to require them to defend their personal beliefs. Then, students are trained to perceive new facts and information, causing them to see the conflict between reality and their value system.

#### Social behavior

Research from Archarya, Blackwell, and Sen

> ...individuals committing violence against members of another group will develop hostile attitudes towards their victims as a way of minimizing cognitive dissonance. ...The application provides a social psychological basis for the constructivist viewpoint that ethnic and racial divisions can be socially or individually constructed.

### Alternative Paradigms

#### Self-discrepancy theory

Three selves:

1. Actual self – representation of the attributes the person believes him or herself to possess (basic self-concept)
2. Ideal self – ideal attributes the person would like to possess (hopes, aspiration, motivations to change)
3. Ought self – ideal attributes the person believes he or she should possess (duties, obligations, responsibilities)

> When these self-guides are contradictory psychological distress (cognitive dissonance) results.

#### Predictive dissonance model

This model relates to the idea that cognitive dissonance is fundamentally related to the [predictive coding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predictive_coding) model of cognition.

> A predictive processing account of the mind proposes that perception actively involves the use of a Bayesian hierarchy of acquired prior knowledge, which primarily serves the role of predicting incoming proprioceptive, interoceptive and exteroceptive sensory inputs.

- Bayesian - a method of statistical inference in which Bayes' theorem (describes the probability of an event) is used to update the probability for a hypothesis as more evidence or information becomes available
- [Proprioceptive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proprioception) - the sense of self-movement and body position.
- [Interoceptive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interoception) - sense of the internal state of the body.
- Exteroceptive - The perception of environmental stimuli acting on the body

> Therefore, the brain is an inference machine which attempts to actively predict and explain its sensations. Crucial to this inference is the minimization of prediction error.

#### [Prediction Error](https://philosophyofbrains.com/2014/06/22/is-prediction-error-minimization-all-there-is-to-the-mind.aspx)

I want to go more in depth about this article that is linked, it is also related to what was written above.

##### Premise

The brain continually seeks to minimize its prediction error.

##### How

We constantly handle sensory input, organising this data instinctively in our mind in ways, fundamentally, set up to handle future predictions.

##### Perception

Our ability to perceive is related to Bayesian inference, the prediction error is based on our current knowledge (prior precision) and how much we are learning from what we are perceiving (likelihood precision). What we perceive is then determined by the currently best performing predictions.

##### Learning

The more we perceive, the more stimuli we absorb, the better our predictions become.

> ...building up a hierarchical model that requires extracting causal regularities over various time scales and using them to predict better.

##### Attention

Expectations of the precisions of prediction errors, discerning a "worthwhile signal".

> This is because attention is allocation of resources to worthwhile signals, and expectations of precisions can guide prediction error efforts to worthwhile or precise signals.

##### Understanding

Picking a reasonable model (a set of interrelated predictions) for making sense of a specific domain (part of life).

> Hence we should expect the prediction error minimizing brain to be engaged in model selection and complexity reduction, in other words, that it will aim at understanding.

##### Confusion

Not knowing which model to select for a specific domain.

##### Action

A hypothesis we may have contains predictions. We discern if a hypothesis is true by testing it on sensory input. If our hypothesis is false, we can do one of two things. Change our hypothesis to fit the sensory input or change the sensory input to fit the hypothesis.

> ...we have to conceive of action in terms of a competition of hypotheses about what the true state of the world is

- The more we act, the more predictions we will obtain to alter our hypotheses.

###### An example

> For example, one (actually true) hypothesis is that my hand is close to the keyboard and another (actually false) hypothesis is that my hand is on the cup of coffee next to me. Action ensues when the actually false hypothesis begins to win, which it does when I increasingly mistrust the actual sensory input: the false hypothesis is then made true by minimizing its prediction error as my hand reaches out for the cup.

- Perhaps, something in our mind desires the coffee. And our hypothesis states that our hand is close the keyboard. But it wishes to be on the coffee. Our hypothesis is false, the coffee is not on our hand. But we can change our hypothesis. We tell our hand that the coffee can be on the hand, and to change our action, touch the cup, drink the coffee. The hypothesis becomes true.

**This has to be explained better**

And back to wikipedia:

### Neuroscience Findings

To earnestly understand these studies, I need to learn the syntax of the brain.

#### Visualisation

![The location in the brain of cognitive dissonance](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/10/MRI_anterior_cingulate.png)

The biomechanics of cognitive dissonance: MRI evidence indicates that the greater the psychological conflict signalled by the [anterior cingulate cortex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anterior_cingulate_cortex), the greater the magnitude of the cognitive dissonance experienced by the person.

##### How Choice Reveals and Shapes Expected Hedonic Outcome (2009)

> ...indicates that after making a choice, neural activity in the striatum changes to reflect the person's new evaluation of the choice-object; neural activity increased if the object was chosen, neural activity decreased if the object was rejected. [Citation](https://web.archive.org/web/20110617053852/https://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/~tsharot/Sharot_JofN_2009.pdf)

- So this is to say that if you choose something, the mind is more active than if you reject something. Perhaps this has to do with the fact that a choice relates to more actions in the future in relation to this thing, so your brain has to prepare itself for future knowledge in relation to this choice.

##### The Neural Basis of Rationalization: Cognitive Dissonance Reduction During Decision-making (2010)

> The results indicated that the active reduction of psychological dissonance increased neural activity in the right-[inferior frontal gyrus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inferior_frontal_gyrus), in the medial fronto-parietal region, and in the ventral [striatum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Striatum), and that neural activity decreased in the [anterior insula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insular_cortex). That the neural activities of rationalization occur in seconds, without conscious deliberation on the part of the person; and that the brain engages in emotional responses whilst effecting decisions. [Citation](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3150852/)

- The inferior frontal gyrus - the location of Broca's area involved in language processing and speech production.
- Striatum - coordinates multiple aspects of cognition, including both motor and action planning, decision-making, motivation, reinforcement, and reward perception.
- Insula - believed to be involved in consciousness and play a role in diverse functions usually linked to emotion or the regulation of the body's homeostasis. These functions include compassion and empathy, perception, motor control, self-awareness, cognitive functioning, and interpersonal experience.

I mainly wrote this down as some research into the structure of the brain. This is a vague study.

#### Emotional correlations

##### Contributions from Research on Anger and Cognitive Dissonance to Understanding the Motivational Functions of Asymmetrical Frontal Brain Activity (2004)

> ...indicate that the occurrence of cognitive dissonance is associated with neural activity in the left frontal cortex, a brain structure also associated with the emotion of anger; moreover, functionally, anger motivates neural activity in the left frontal cortex.

- Again, a part of the brain.
- [Frontal Lobe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frontal_lobe) - The entirety of the frontal cortex is the action cortex. It is devoted to action of one kind or another: skeletal movement, ocular movement, speech control, the expression of emotions.

##### Anger and the Behavioural Approach System (2003)

> ...indicated that the relation between cognitive dissonance and anger is supported by neural activity in the left frontal cortex that occurs when a person takes control of the social situation causing the cognitive dissonance. Conversely, if the person cannot control or cannot change the psychologically stressful situation, he or she is without a motivation to change the circumstance, then there arise other, negative emotions to manage the cognitive dissonance, such as socially inappropriate behavior.

- Again, left frontal cortex. But with an two ideas that are fitting. If you take on a task that is against what you believe, you will feel anger, you will be upset. If there is a problem that you have no control of but you feel entitled to have control, you may act inappropriately.

#### The psychology of mental stress

##### An Action-based Model of Cognitive-dissonance Processes (2015)

> A participant read aloud the printed name of a color. To test for the occurrence of cognitive dissonance, the name of the color was printed in a color different than the word read aloud by the participant. As a result, the participants experienced increased neural activity in the anterior cingulate cortex when the experimental exercises provoked psychological dissonance.

- Anterior cingulate cortex - involved in certain higher-level functions, such as attention allocation, reward anticipation, decision-making, ethics and morality, impulse control (e.g. performance monitoring and error detection), and emotion.
- This is a quite exact experiment. Very simple, archaic way to test dissonance on the mind. Read a color that is colored in a different color than the color (I expect the different color is not black or white).
- TODO: read more on this

### Modeling in neural networks

This is a whole nother topic to put a days work towards, kind of, understanding.
