description: "I began with learning Canvas, realised it would take too long to make charts with pure Canvas. Moved to Chart.js. Then, I went to a meetup, and added a few tiny notes to this app I use. Realised, I haven't put a lot of stuff in there on the internet, and put it. It's a lot"

## Canvas Tutorial

### Basics

#### The `canvas` element

Only contains two attributes, width and height

> The element can be sized arbitrarily by CSS, but during rendering the image is scaled to fit its layout size: if the CSS sizing doesn't respect the ratio of the initial canvas, it will appear distorted.

    - So it's best to specify dimensions when it is created.

#### Fallback in case not accessible by users

```html
<canvas id="stockGraph" width="150" height="150">
  current stock price: $3.15 + 0.15
</canvas>
```

#### Init steps

```js
var canvas = document.getElementById('tutorial');
var ctx = canvas.getContext('2d');
```

#### Super simple

Say, for example, you have this canvas:

`<canvas id="canvas" width="150" height="150"></canvas>`

And, you want to fill it completely with a black background. This is the JS needed:

```js
var canvas = document.getElementById('canvas');
var ctx = canvas.getContext('2d');

ctx.fillRect(0, 0, 0, 150);
```

- params for `fillRect`:

  1. Where to start at x-axis
  2. Where to start at y-axis
  3. Width of x (from 1)
  4. Height of y (from 2)

- Note: The rectangle never extends outside of the canvas.

### Drawing Shapes with Canvas

#### Canvas Grid (or coordinate space)

- Coordinates generally correspond to pixels

#### Drawing rectangles

`fillRect(x, y, width, height)`

- Filled rectangle

`strokeRect(x, y, width, height)`

- Rectangular outline

`clearRect(x, y, width, height)`

- Clears specified rectangular area -> makes it transparent

Ex.

```js
var canvas = document.getElementById('canvas');
if (canvas.getContext) {
  var ctx = canvas.getContext('2d');

  ctx.fillRect(25, 25, 100, 100);
  ctx.clearRect(45, 45, 60, 60);
  ctx.strokeRect(50, 50, 50, 50);
}
```

- Will create a square with white space cleared in the middle with a stroked rectangle in this cleared space.

Ex of a smiley face:

```js
var canvas = document.getElementById('canvas');
if (canvas.getContext) {
  var ctx = canvas.getContext('2d');

  ctx.beginPath();
  ctx.arc(75, 75, 50, 0, Math.PI * 2, true); // Outer circle
  ctx.moveTo(110, 75);
  ctx.arc(75, 75, 35, 0, Math.PI, false); // Mouth (clockwise)
  ctx.moveTo(65, 65);
  ctx.arc(60, 65, 5, 0, Math.PI * 2, true); // Left eye
  ctx.moveTo(95, 65);
  ctx.arc(90, 65, 5, 0, Math.PI * 2, true); // Right eye
  ctx.stroke();
}
```

## Using chart.js

### Accessibility

```html
<canvas
  id="goodCanvas1"
  width="400"
  height="100"
  aria-label="Hello ARIA World"
  role="img"
  ><p>Fallback text</p></canvas
>
```

### Events can be specified

```js
var chart = new Chart(ctx, {
  type: 'line',
  data: data,
  options: {
    // This chart will not respond to the other events (mousemove, mouseout, touchstart, touchmove)
    events: ['click']
  }
});
```

### Interaction modes

Try them all out

```js
var chart = new Chart(ctx, {
  type: 'line',
  data: data,
  options: {
    tooltips: {
      // mode: 'point'
      // mode: 'nearest'
      // mode: 'index'
      // mode: 'dataset'
      // mode: 'x'
      // mode: 'y'
      // etc.
    }
  }
});
```

### Scriptable options

```js
color: function(context) {
    var index = context.dataIndex;
    var value = context.dataset.data[index];
    return value < 0 ? 'red' :  // draw negative values in red
        index % 2 ? 'blue' :    // else, alternate values in blue and green
        'green';
}
```

```js
color: [
    'red',    // color for data at index 0
    'blue',   // color for data at index 1
    'green',  // color for data at index 2
    'black',  // color for data at index 3
```

### Global Configuration

Options that are on all charts by default

- ex. `Chart.defaults.global.hover.mode = 'nearest';`

### Layout configuration

```js
options: {
  layout: {
      padding: {
          left: 50,
          right: 0,
          top: 0,
          bottom: 0
      }
  }
}
```

## Clear App on my phone, put long overdue stuff here:

### Bettina Pousttchi

- Her work is very raw, like reality. And people tend to write very metaphysical, deep, and heavy articles about her work. I read through one of these books. With her artwork and essays written about the artwork. And, continually I ran into sentences that made me stop and think. So, below is a link to some articles about her artwork, so that one day I may read it and document some of these works.

#### [Texts](http://www.pousttchi.com/texts)

### Don't forget about Brain Pickings

[Site](https://www.brainpickings.org/)

Subscribed to email

#### [Poems of Space](https://www.brainpickings.org/2017/04/11/jocelyn-bell-burnell-dark-matter-poetry-stanley-kunitz/)

- Which is likely me telling me to buy this book one day, to satisfy my space/faith interconnection... perhaps it's part of the sense this spirit of mine needs

#### [The universe in verse](https://www.brainpickings.org/?s=the+universe+in+verse)

- More for my universe fetish

#### [All these wonders](https://www.brainpickings.org/2017/04/17/neil-gaiman-the-moth-presents-all-these-wonders/)

- A collection of stories from storytellers in the "Moth Community"... Neil Gaiman

#### [Wild Ideas](https://www.brainpickings.org/?s=wild+ideas)

- Umm... a childrens book. Maybe keep track of it if well, I ever need such a thing. It's an interesting premise: a picture book presenting an imaginative and illuminating catalog of various animals’ problem-solving strategies, from how dung beetles use stars as a navigation system to the procrastination tactics of pigeons.
- It's one of those books where the pictures come out of the page at you.

#### [Material World: a global family portrait](https://www.brainpickings.org/2011/04/08/material-world-peter-menzel/)

Well... looking at a book like this makes me wonder why I have not volunteered in a while.

> an engrossing visual time-capsule of life in 30 countries, captured by 16 of the world’s leading photographers. In each of the 30 countries, Menzel found a statistically average family and photographed them outside their home, with all of their belongings. The result is an incredible cross-cultural quilt of possessions, from the utilitarian to the sentimental, revealing the faceted and varied ways in which we use “stuff” to make sense of the world and our place in it.

Fascinating

### If I ever get into writing again, this is an interesting tool:

[Inkitt](https://www.inkitt.com/)

### If I feel content in life for some interesting hobbies

[The Stone: About](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Stone_(music_space)>)

[Events](http://thestonenyc.com/)

### Nadifa Mohamed

I wrote her name down, not sure why. Her writing looks interesting though.

> ...a semi-biographical account of her father's life in Yemen in the 1930s and '40s, during the colonial period.

### If I ever live in Cobble Hill

[Books are magic](https://www.booksaremagic.net/)... bet i just noted it down one night after I drank a bit too much and went on a long walk

### Ayi Kwei Armah

Another African writer I noted for some forgotten reason. Likely as I love the feeling of Africa in fiction, in the spoken word, i'm sure i'd love it. One day i must go, hopefully for several years.

[His wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ayi_Kwei_Armah)

> The trans-Atlantic and African slave trades are the subject of Armah's Two Thousand Seasons (1973), in which a pluralized communal voice speaks through the history of Africa, its wet and dry seasons, from a period of one thousand years. Arab and European oppressors are portrayed as "predators," "destroyers," and "zombies". The novel is written in allegorical tone, and shifts from autobiographical and realistic details to philosophical pondering, prophesying a new age.

### If i'm ever financially settled, this is a good thing to use from time to time:

[Today Tix](https://www.todaytix.com/)

### Park Ave Armory is there to possible check out one day and see some fancy art

### Don't let the damn fall, don't let the guy stab you in two directions, group expand first if need to make eyes, attack the corners in the opening, 3x3 death, monkey jump

IDK WHAT THIS IS. I have two theories.

1. Someone crazy uttered this and I wrote it down (most likely)
2. I had some crazy dream and wrote this down (less likely)

### [React Reconciliation](https://reactjs.org/docs/reconciliation.html)

### [Success In Tech](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-vYrOAmtrx9sBzJAf3x_xw), should i care?

### Go to the [National Museum of Mathematics](https://momath.org/)

Cause math is, you know, the language of the universe.

### Purify CSS

Back to tech. [Github](https://github.com/purifycss/purifycss).

- removes unused CSS rules. So, it's probably smart to run this prior to webpack. Can be done standalone or in the process.
- Create react app doesn't do it, it's likely a good idea to do it prior to the build process than.

### This looks sweet as well

[Size-limit](https://github.com/ai/size-limit) to assure low JS budget.

### Philip Pullman and [His Dark Materials](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/His_Dark_Materials)

Allan recommended this book. He doesn't recommend much and is wise so there is possibility here.

### We work remotely for when i'm ready to get remote work again

### Maybe learn more about progressive web apps in the future

[Google's Workbox](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/workbox/)

### Kyle probably told me to read this:

[The Burrow by Kafka](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Burrow_(short_story)>)

### Don't ever buy a fancy camera, I know you're going to want to buy one like the Fujifilm x-t20

### [What Startups can learn from chef culture](https://www.devflix.watch/video/JW6-XR3fSJA)

I should watch and write some ideas as I'm looking for work right now

And these two talks as well:

- [The Coding Chef](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7AvltW48Xk)
- [How long on that ticket](https://www.elastic.co/videos/how-long-on-that-ticket-proven-recipes-that-enhance-collaboration-by-juan-pablo-buritica-and-patricia-realini)

### [There is so much to read in this world](https://blog.oup.com/)

Oxford University's blog, if i continue this rabbit hole... [MIT's blog](https://mitpress.mit.edu/blog)? Oh, and now [Harvard has a Data Science Review](https://hdsr.mitpress.mit.edu/)

And MIT has some open source I can contribute to: [MIT media lab](https://github.com/mitmedialab)

### Some silly crap about being a New Yorker

> You become a New Yorker when instead of looking at the crossing signal, you look at the traffic lights

> A New Yorker will not break stride if they don't have to, even if it means to do a little dance to get by

### From a ted talk

[The dictionary of obscure sorrows](https://www.dictionaryofobscuresorrows.com/)

I remember this one and here it is in the site:

midding

> v. intr. feeling the tranquil pleasure of being near a gathering but not quite in it—hovering on the perimeter of a campfire, chatting outside a party while others dance inside, resting your head in the backseat of a car listening to your friends chatting up front—feeling blissfully invisible yet still fully included, safe in the knowledge that everyone is together and everyone is okay, with all the thrill of being there without the burden of having to be.

### Probably from another TED talk

[William Bazinsky](http://www.mmlxii.com/store/)

- likely should listen to some of his work. He's an experimental musician.

And this is an album:

![william bazinsky pod tune: whale human music](https://s9.limitedrun.com/images/1163216/v300_Pod_Tune_Cover_medium.jpg)

### Shantaram

Curiosity as a value

Values -> Behaviours

- How do your values lead to behaviours to reinforce these values?

What is the road map for the company and how do you impact it?
