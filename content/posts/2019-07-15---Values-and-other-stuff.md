## TL;DR

## Method to the writing

> This is the companies explanation

- If this, it's a note.

My interpretation is here.

## Facebook's

[Values](https://www.facebook.com/careers/facebook-life)

### Be Bold

> Building great things means taking risks. We have a saying: "The riskiest thing is to take no risks." in a world that's changing so quickly you're guaranteed to fail if you dont take any risks.

- There is oddly a spelling error in their site - dont should be don't.

Socially, call people out. Life-wise, don't be afraid to step out of your comfort zone and if an idea comes along that you cannot let go, act upon it.

### Focus on Impact

> To make the most impact, we need to solve the most important problems. We expect Facebook employees to avoid wasting time on minor issues and focus on truly big challenges.

Impact: have a strong effect on someone or something.

Put your effort on the concepts more so than the details. Look deeply into what you do rather than the surface level.

### Move Fast

> We believe that itâ€™s better to move fast and make mistakes than to move slowly and miss opportunities. Doing so enables us to build more things and learn faster.

Trust your instinct.
