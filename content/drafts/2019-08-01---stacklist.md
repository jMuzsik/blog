## Becoming a talent maker

### Finding talent

Going to places that "top companies" don't go to.

Develop the conviction to be able to make an offer before they leave the office.

Be thoughtful about what matters to you and create a process that people that fit this criteria.

- Be thoughtful about how you hire.
- Develop a culture of hiring. Committed to the idea of the importance of talent (the most important).
  - One that acts on this is a talent maker.

### Three roles to be a talent maker

Act as a talent leader. Building a leading a culture of hiring. Show up and give your attention to it. Visibly put effort into the hiring process.

Act as a talent magnet. Actively/personally engaged to the talent. Someone who is hands on in telling the strory of the company/brand.

People that are running the process (recruiter).

## Star vs Skills vs Value system of startups

Star - Ivy league

Skills - looking for employees of a particular skill-set

Value - Hire based on shared commitments/values

## Frontend and backend developers

### Passionate about the nuts and bolts - "Backend developer"

### Passionate about creating beautiful UX - "Frontend developer"

## Linkedin technique

Connect + "hey, I really liked your profile, I'd love to get a coffee"

## Screening

Startup - See if they believe in what we believe in and come with ideas. Someone that can work without needing to be told what to do.

12+ - Value driven screening. How does each candidate fare with the company values? The three whys (what really motivates someone)?

### Some questions

Tell me about your best day of work over the last few years.

Something about figuring out how people are like to work with.

How much do you need to make so you're not worried about bills and you can take a vacation?

What did this person do to this companies success and what could they have done?

Early stage startup's should hire people that can take change in stride. The ability to handle constant changes. (grit and curiosity)
