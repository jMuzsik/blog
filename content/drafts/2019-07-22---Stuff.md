## Reselect again

Basically, at times where you are mapping state to a component. If the state being passed is a new object or array with the same data, then the component will render again. So, reselect will prevent a new object, array, etc. from being created when the data does not change.

During times where the selector is in a reuseable component:

```js
// The reuseable component file
// ...
function ReuseableComponent({ someState }) {
  return <somehtml>{someState}</somehtml>;
}
// A component that uses this reuseable component
// ...
function componentThatUsesReusableComponent() {
  return (
    <div>
      <ReuseableComponent someState={'this is some state'} />
      <ReuseableComponent
        someState={'this is some other state with the same state name'}
      />
    </div>
  );
}
```

And the `createSelector` function is used to compute `someState`, it will cause a re-render each time. The reason for this is that the `createSelector` function is the same function in both instances of the reuseable component. So, it is continually altering the state.

The way to prevent this from happening looks like this:

```js
const makeGetVisibleTodos = () => {
  return createSelector(
    [getVisibilityFilter, getTodos],
    (visibilityFilter, todos) => {
      switch (visibilityFilter) {
        case 'SHOW_COMPLETED':
          return todos.filter(todo => todo.completed);
        case 'SHOW_ACTIVE':
          return todos.filter(todo => !todo.completed);
        default:
          return todos;
      }
    }
  );
};
```

So that a new instance of `createSelector` is instantiated for each instance of the reuseable component.

## More notes on PWA starter kit

### one-way data binding

Basically this is React:

```js
render() {
    return <input value={this.state.value} onChange={this.handleChange} />
}
handleChange(e) {
    this.setState({value: e.target.value});
}
```

### If saving to local storage, do something like this:

```js
export const saveState = state => {
  let stringifiedState = JSON.stringify(state);
  localStorage.setItem(MY_KEY, stringifiedState);
};
export const loadState = () => {
  let json = localStorage.getItem(MY_KEY) || '{}';
  let state = JSON.parse(json);

  if (state) {
    return state;
  } else {
    return undefined; // To use the defaults in the reducers
  }
};
// ...
export const store = createStore(
  state => state,
  loadState(), // If there is local storage data, load it.
  compose(
    lazyReducerEnhancer(combineReducers),
    applyMiddleware(thunk)
  )
);

// This subscriber writes to local storage anytime the state updates.
store.subscribe(() => {
  saveState(store.getState());
});
```

## Cooperative Scheduling of Background Tasks

This specification is focused on running background tasks when the browser is idle. At a time separate from the event loop to ensure that the tasks don't impact latency-critical events such as animation and input response.

> Examples of background tasks include recording analytics data, long running data processing operations, client-side templating and pre-rendering of content likely to become visible in the near future.

This is dope
