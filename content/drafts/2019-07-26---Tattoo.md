## Tattoo

I had one tattoo in my life. Got it in Ecuador a few days before April 18th. On my chest, centered.

I wanted one thing. To symbolise the way I see life at it's core. As a mystery. As something that is beyond our understanding. Whenever I think of life, I think of how it all began. I think of the beginning of the universe. I think of surprise. The fact that this universe was born inexplicably. We have no explanation that has theoretically been proven. The closest truth we have is The Big Bang. And, most likely, in my lifetime, we will not go beyond that. Or if we do, we will have another confusing scenario to overcome.

I wholeheartedly believe, as the essence of what we root from cannot be explained than our lives cannot be. We should, from time to time, look at ourselves and be surprised that we even exist.

Will we find an explanation? Will we find how The Big Bang occurred? I do not think so. This idea that everything needs a beginning is human. It is part of our assumptions of reality. As all of our experiences are based on there being a beginning to occurrences. Also, that is the law of our universe. Ever since The Big Bang occurred. **Matter spewed out. Matter coagulated. Matter turned into globs, globs became galaxies containing stars, et al.** There are beginnings and ends.

It's not only about the idea of a beginning and end, there are many parts of this universe we do not even understand. There is dark energy and dark matter. We do understand the universe we live in. 

And to talk about the state of being human. We know we are human. We have thoughts and beliefs and ideas. There is metaphysics and consciousness, which we often do not attribute to material constraints. But back to The Big Bang.

It will, I must say again, likely never be explained. And again, if it is, it will lead to another mystery. This mystery we can only think of as something we cannot attach logic to. We cannot attribute truth to it. The fact that the universe exists is a surprise. This thought is inescapable.

Hence, my tattoo. The beginning of all things. The core of what I am.

Why a tattoo? The main reason is why would I not attach something that means everything to me to me for the rest of my life. It also helps that I was in a place that I loved with all my heart (Montanita Ecuador) and a real tattoo artist was there to do the work.

And here is the pic.

And the poem that the tattoo artist connected to it:

### Circles Of Life - Poem by Suzy Kassem

```
Everything
Turns, 
Rotates, 
Spins, 
Circles, 
Loops, 
Pulsates, 
Resonates, 
And
Repeats.

Circles
Of life, 
Born from
Pulses
Of light, 
Vibrate
To
Breathe, 
While
Spiraling
Outwards
For
Infinity
Through
The lens
Of time, 
And into
A sea
Of stars
And
Lucid
Dreams.
``` 

There is so much more to say, all I know is that a foundation has been built. I have the rest of my life to architect it.

### Some side notes

#### Composition of the universe

> ~68% dark energy, ~27% dark matter, ~5% normal matter

So wtheck is with that?

> We are much more certain what dark matter is not than we are what it is. First, it is dark, meaning that it is not in the form of stars and planets that we see. Observations show that there is far too little visible matter in the universe to make up the 27% required by the observations. Second, it is not in the form of dark clouds of normal matter, matter made up of particles called baryons. We know this because we would be able to detect baryonic clouds by their absorption of radiation passing through them. Third, dark matter is not antimatter, because we do not see the unique gamma rays that are produced when antimatter annihilates with matter. Finally, we can rule out large galaxy-sized black holes on the basis of how many gravitational lenses we see. High concentrations of matter bend light passing near them from objects further away, but we do not see enough lensing events to suggest that such objects to make up the required 25% dark matter contribution.

> However, at this point, there are still a few dark matter possibilities that are viable. Baryonic matter could still make up the dark matter if it were all tied up in brown dwarfs or in small, dense chunks of heavy elements. These possibilities are known as massive compact halo objects, or "MACHOs". But the most common view is that dark matter is not baryonic at all, but that it is made up of other, more exotic particles like axions or WIMPS (Weakly Interacting Massive Particles).

Umm... I need to study more about this, as that is an unclear explanation by NASA
