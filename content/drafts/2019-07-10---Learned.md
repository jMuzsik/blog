## A react pattern I should utilise more often

```js
something.filter(doFilter(this.state.query));

function doFilter(query) {
  return function(user) {
    return query === user.name;
  };
}
```

Use higher order functions more often.

## On the topic of React, really, what is the virtual DOM

My notes state this:

• Recursively nested objects that reference DOM elements. And the references are, if I’m remembering correctly, a linked list of elements, with algorithms and data structures behind to properly handle the list. There is also other little optimisations that I don’t understand well enough. lot’s of recursion.

- It is basically a bunch of calls to `new whateverElementIsReferencedInObject`, `element.addEventListener`, e`lement.className = ...`, etc.

Which is...?

### And Refs?

• A special identifier that can be referenced at specific instances of time. Useful to do vanilla JS released to styling, or adding classnames, etc. to an element in the confines of React

### Some dudes useful way to handle a React project already in existence, he does this:

My 3 Steps for any project:

1. Load page on Chrome, use Coverage Tool (DevTools => Ctrl+Shift+P => type "Coverage" => press Drawer: Coverage),
2. Press reload icon and see how much unused code you are shipping init. page load.
3. Find those modules and lazy load with import()

Sounds about right, keep that bundle small.

He goes deeper:

> PRPL (Push, Render, Precache and Lazy-Load) is a pattern for aggressively splitting code for every single route, then taking advantage of a service worker to pre-cache the JavaScript and logic needed for future routes, and lazy load it as needed.

## [Learn JS, then React](https://www.robinwieruch.de/javascript-fundamentals-react-requirements/)

This quote:

> In conclusion, there is lots of JavaScript which can be harnessed in React. Whereas React has only a slim API surface area, developers have to get used to all the functionalities JavaScript has to offer. The saying is not without any reason: “being a React developer makes you a better JavaScript developer”.

- I personally, do agree that learning the right things about JS will greatly assist you, like in the article you should definitely keep up with being able to write quality JS code with Objects, Arrays, etc. All the new and cool stuff.
  - BUT, that only touches a surface level. A hard level to get to but there are deeper elements of JS such as lower level data structures or Browser API's that one should also put time into learning.
  - Though, still, React's new features are often simultaneously integral to understand. Hooks, Context, Suspense, etc. Understanding these tools are vital for a React Developer.

## Something from a Triple Byte article

> Engineers who use Go are also especially strong. If you know why, please let me know.

This is in relation to Triple Byte's programming tests (mainly in relation to data structures/algorithm stuff). And people who take the tests in Go tend to pass regularly:

![chart showing what programming languages people pass triplebyte exams with](https://d25hn4jiqx5f7l.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/files/original/2d91c7bc54323641aa5e69ca602bdd01935d21ee.png?1543937547)

## Some stuff about JavaScipt, things to think about JavaScript

Next few things are thanks to this awesome article: [Preparing for a Front-End Web Development Interview at Top Tech Companies](https://davidshariff.com/blog/preparing-for-a-front-end-web-development-interview-in-2017/#first-article)

- Mainly, it initialised the following learning, but i still have more to parse in the article.

### JS

```js
// Traversal up and down the tree
const el = document.querySelector('.some-el');
const parent = el.parentNode;
const firstChild = el.firstChild;
const lastChild = el.lastChild;
const children = el.childNodes;

// Traversal left and right
const previousSibling = el.previousSibling;
const nextSibling = el.nextSibling;
```

From MDN, I think, about `DocumentFragment`

> A common use for `DocumentFragment` is to create one, assemble a DOM subtree within it, then append or insert the fragment into the DOM using Node interface methods such as `appendChild()` or `insertBefore()`. Doing this moves the fragment's nodes into the DOM, leaving behind an empty DocumentFragment. Because all of the nodes are inserted into the document at once, only one reflow and render is triggered instead of potentially one for each node inserted if they were inserted separately.

```html
<ul id="list"></ul>

<script>
  var list = document.querySelector('#list');
  var fruits = ['Apple', 'Orange', 'Banana', 'Melon'];

  var fragment = document.createDocumentFragment();

  fruits.forEach(function(fruit) {
    var li = document.createElement('li');
    li.innerHTML = fruit;
    fragment.appendChild(li);
  });

  list.appendChild(fragment);
</script>
```

- So, if you ever need to create a bunch of elements on the fly, use `DocumentFragment` to prevent the DOM from updating more than once.

And these two things I wrote:

- Cache created DOM nodes, and use them as a pool of pre-assembled elements you can put back in the page as needed.

  - So if for whatever reason you need to create lots of elements for common use cases, cache these elements, be prepared in a way? I wonder what React does

- Look for excessive repaints and reflows or massive waves of DOM manipulation.
  - In other words, learn how to use Performance dev tools better. And record page load, things like that. Likely, when you have time take those Google Performance free courses on Udacity again. Was a long time ago.

### CSS

```css
/* descendant selector */
ul li {
  margin: 0 0 5px 0;
}
/* child selector */
ul > li {
  margin: 0 0 5px 0;
}
```

#### ID's vs Classes

I tend to use classes too much and rarely ID's but I should use ID's more often, I know this.

Someone on Stack Overflow states this:

> A good way to remember this is a class is a type of item and the id is the unique name of an item on the page.

- So use ID's for a page, that's the main gist. classes for reuseable stuff.

#### BEM

Basically, `.some-class__thing-in-class`

### HTML5 - Ya, I have a lot to learn...

`<header>` header for document or individual section

- Same with footer, but opposite

`<main>` main content of a document

`<article>` self contained composition in a document. Intended to be distributable or reusable.

`<aside>` portion of document only indirectly related to main content

`<section>` standalone section in document, generally with a header

`<details>` and `<summary>`

- This will create an accordion, summary is the title, text is what is seen when clicked

```html
<details>
  <summary> Details </summary>
  Something small enough to escape casual notice.
</details>
```

`<dialog>` similar to a notification

```html
<dialog open>this is seen</dialog>
<dialog>this is not seen</dialog>
```

`<figure>` and `<figcaption>`

- Used for an image that has a description. The description is right below the image.

```html
<figure>
  <img ... />
  <figcaption>...</figcaption>
</figure>
```

`<mark>` Highlights text

`<nav>` For a section of a page that provides navigation links

`<meter>` creates a battery looking thing

- It even changes colors based on the low/high/optimum values

```html
<label for="fuel"> Fuel level: </label>
<meter
  id="fuel"
  name="fuel"
  min="0"
  max="100"
  low="33"
  high="66"
  optimum="80"
  value="50"
>
  this is like the alt
</meter>
```

`<progress>` shows indicator for the completion progress of a task

```html
<label for="file"> File progress: </label>
<progress id="“file”" max="“100”" value="“30”">
  alt for it
</progress>
```

`<summary>` for a summary, caption, or legend for `<details>`

`<time>` represents a specific period in time.

```html
<!-- date time can represent three forms of time -->
<!-- Precise date -->
<time datetime="2018-07-07"> July 7 </time>
<!-- Time on a 24 hour clock -->
<time datetime="20:00"> 20:00 </time>
<!-- A valid time duration -->
<time datetime="PT2H30M"> 2h 30m </time>
```

`<dl>` - for a row of definitions

- `<dt>` - is the word
- `<dd>` - is the definition

Write way to do a form:

```html
<form>
  <fieldset>
    <legend>...</legend>
    <!-- inputs and other stuff -->
  </fieldset>
</form>
```

And now for something completely different:
