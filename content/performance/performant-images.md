### Choose Appropriate Image Types

> As a rule of thumb, use PNGs for clip art, line drawings, or wherever you need transparency, JPGs for photographs, and GIFs when you need animation.

### Size images based on their intended use

> Large images take longer to download than smaller ones. All your images should be appropriately sized for their intended use and should not rely on the browser to resize them for rendering.

### Crop images to show only what's important

### Reduce image quality if there is no perceptible difference
