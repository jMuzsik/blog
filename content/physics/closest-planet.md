## Mercury is the closest planet to every other planet on average

![Closest planet to earth diagram](https://www.extremetech.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/media_sizes_full_figure4.gif)

What is being shown above is the fact that throughout the year Mercury is closest to the Earth. To go further than that, Mercury is closer, on average (throughout the year) to every planet on the solar system.

That may be counterintuitive because of these facts:

- 0.39 AU = Mercury's distance from the Sun
- 0.723 AU = Venus's distance from the Sun
- 1 AU (149.6 million km) = Earth's distance from the Sun
- 1.524 AU = Mar's distance from the Sun

Well, the reason can be discerned in the above diagram. Mercury is repeatedly in the same place. Close to the sun. While the planets (Earth included) are often large distances away from each other in their orbital path. So, each planet is closest to Mercury on average throughout the year.
