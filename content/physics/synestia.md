## The prevalent theory as to how the moon was created - A synestia

[Synestia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synestia)

1. Earth collided with an object of extremely high energy and angular momentum.
2. The entirety of earth's material existence becomes elemental matter (dust-like). It expands its diameter. Surface temperatures are around 3700 Â°C.
3. Heat is radiated to space. Magma droplets form in the outer layers, raining inward over tens of years. The elemental matter contracts to become more earth-like.
4. Mass remaining outside the Roche limit (is in a way now separate from the earth, so it will then coalesce to form it's own object - the moon in this case) first formed moonlets and then the moon was created.
5. The Earth re-formed later, once the synestia had cooled sufficiently to fall within the co-rotational limit.

> By this model, the Moon's having formed within a cloud of vapor that originated from the Earth is why its isotopic ratios are similar to those of the Earth. The later formation of the Earth (after the synestia cooled) accounts for its having accreted more volatile elements than the Moon.
