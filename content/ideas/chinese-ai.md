> Some silly idea i have for a skit

## Premise

Why is China spending a [ton of money on AI](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/china-is-overtaking-the-us-as-the-leader-in-artificial-intelligence-2019-02-27)? For future warfare. Imagine this. World War 3. China/etc vs the US/etc. China has created this robot that can distinguish all races from Asian. These robots are basically killing machines. One person then the next. These robots are worth their weight in gold compared to other forms of warfare (weapons, soldiers, etc.) And, well, being that the worlds major cities are so biracial. The idea is to put these robots in major cities to only kill those who are not Asian. Eventually creating a racially homogeneous civilization.

### Jokes

1. Get ready for prophesy. This is what the world will lead to. The future of humanity. The governments decided solution to what ails civilization. They are building robots that can distinguish based on race and are going to extinguish all who do not fit this race.
2. Look around the room, point out an Asian person, and if she/he looks from China or the like, say that they are in in this prophesy. They know this is gonna happen.
3. Point out that the world will still run fine as in every city there is a giant population of skilled asians that can run the cities.
4. When aliens come to the earth, they'll see this homogeneous society.

This sounded funnier in my head. Think it has promise if the right words are put in place. The premise is sort of like a thought in the back of everyone's head, as we all wonder when or if there will be a major war between these new superpowers sometime in the future. It roots from Battledecks at Manhattan JS when I got on stage and they put slides for me to do with the beginning premise "The Rise of China" and wondering about the new candidate Yang.

## To expand on Yang

### I believe, at this moment, that I want him to win, why?

Numbers. If you are president, you make decisions that affect society from top to bottom. And, you are at the top. Still, in some ways, you make decisions that alter all of society. And, what speaks louder then emotions? Numbers.

Still the human element perpetually exists, and no one can escape that reality. One decides what they value, they decide what their priorities are. One can say they have conceptual understanding of a multitude of topics but we all are subject to the limited amount of knowledge that we are capable of obtaining. So, what does Yang, what do these other candidates really care about? Their passion, their desires, their thoughts will be directed in that direction. But, back to numbers.

With numbers, an analytical mind can grasp concepts quicker. It's not to say that the concepts are completely understood, but it is to say that there is enough understanding to have a good idea of where to direct ones energies. There can be numbers that say what concepts are most important to focus on. Numbers that tell us where money should be directed. Numbers that tell us what concepts are most important to expound to others. It goes on and on.

And, likely the most interesting element is that when someone's life philosophy revolves around numbers. Their minds should be able to be convinced by those numbers. If the man "on top" of American society is this way, democracy would genuinely be more real. The world, the society we live in, may begin to make a little more sense and perhaps there will actually be some foresight for the future.
