#### 2019

1. Four key metrics
   - Lead time, deployment frequency, mean time to restore (MTTR) and change fail percentage.
2. Micro frontends
   - Many small apps in one app
3. Opinionated and automated code formatting
   - Automatic code formatting
4. Polyglot programming
   - Use languages based on when they are most fitting for the task at hand
5. Secrets as a service
   - For variables needed for API's, etc. use something like AWS KMS

### Platforms

#### Kubernetes is the default solution when deploying containers into a cluster of machines

#### .NET Core... maybe learn a little about it

#### Google Cloud Platform over AWS?

#### [KeyCloak](https://www.keycloak.org/)

Used to to secure the services or APIs through authentication and authorization features

#### WeChat

Commerce can completely be done on this platform. Over 70% of Chinese people utilise this platform.

### Tools

#### Headless Chrome for Front-end test

### Languages and Frameworks

#### Clara Rules

[What is this?](https://www.clara-rules.org/)

#### Perhaps use Echarts in the future

Why? It is entirely based on the Canvas API so performance is great.

#### If you ever need to create something for the bare metal

[Gobot](https://gobot.io/) is written in Go and supports many platforms.

#### [Single-SPA](https://github.com/CanopyTax/single-spa)

> a JavaScript metaframework that allows us to build micro frontends using different frameworks that can coexist in a single application

1. Contentful
   - A headless CMS.
     - The term “headless” comes from the concept of chopping the “head” (the front end, i.e. the website) off the “body” (the back end, i.e. the content repository)
