## Measurement error

`1.35 +/- 0.013`

- Central value +/- uncertainty

  1.3 - uncertainty btw 1.2 and 1.4

  - Two significant digits
    1.30 - uncertainty btw 1.29 and 1.31
  - Three significant digits
    0.00319 -> 3.19 x 10^-3
  - Three significant digits
    3.6cm - 0.57cm = 3.03cm => 3.0cm

For exams:

1. Assume that all data has infinite precision
   - 3.4 = 3.400000
2. All results have at least 3 significant figures
   - 3.325525 -> 3.53 || 3.525 || 3.5252 ...

## Units defined by physical constants

### Time

`1 s = 9192631770 / ΔνCs.`

- **s** is the SI unit of time. It is defined by taking the fixed numerical value of the caesium frequency **ΔνCs**, the unperturbed ground-state hyperfine transition frequency of the caesium-133 atom,[40] to be 9192631770 when expressed in the unit Hz, which is equal to s^-1.

### Length

`1 m = 9192631770c / 299792458ΔνCs`

- The metre, symbol **m**, is the SI unit of length. It is defined by taking the fixed numerical value of the speed of light in vacuum **c** to be _299792458_ when expressed in the unit m \* s^-1, where the second is defined in terms of the caesium frequency **ΔνCs**.

### Mass

`1 kg = (299792458)^2 hΔνCs / (6.62607015 * 10^-34)(9192631770) c^2`

- The kilogram, symbol **kg**, is the SI unit of mass. It is defined by taking the fixed numerical value of the Planck constant **h** to be _6.62607015×10^-34_ when expressed in the unit *J*s*, which is equal to *kg⋅m2⋅s^−1*, where the metre and the second are defined in terms of *c* and **ΔνCs**.
