## Clarification

First of all, what I basically have to do is create a web application and hook up the API's so that Yoga Design Labs can comfortably be integrated with the Zalando API? Just for clarification.

## Chronological

Can you tell me what steps I have to take, chronologically, to setup Yoga Design Labs to be fully integrated into Zalando's system? My contract specifies that all I am really doing is setting up what is required and what API calls are very helpful for the client... like data related to orders, etc.

## Product submission

I see that there is the Silhouette Guide. Does that show all required fields for product submission?

Have you looked at the Google Sheet for each product that Bianca has setup? Would you mind looking at it and making sure that there is nothing missing. It's hard to tell because you have not finished creating the documentation for the endpoint.

## You keep adding stuff to the documentation

Are you going to add more and more calls?

## Prior applications

Are there prior applications that I can view? It would save me quite a bit of time to be able to reference other code related to this.

## Testing

I know that there is the sandbox database. Is there any way that I can test a database already containing data for the endpoints I am working with? Like I cannot post orders, etc. so I have no data to work with, and because of that I cannot make sure that the endpoints work prior to going live.

## Information

There is a lot of info on the Zalando Partner site, can you point out the most useful information for me on this website?
