Born and raised in the Bronx. Before joining the tech world, I was a chef in NYC. Currently, I am a Web Developer with a focus on UX and performance. And all the other cool new things. React, Node, and the giant ecosystem around it, which I have consumed a healthy portion of over my time in this field.</p>\n<p>I’ve made some things over time. Like this: <a href=\"https://findanissue.com/\">Find an issue</a>. And a bunch of sites for the company I have been working at: <a href=\"https://meeplabs.com/\">Meep Labs</a> (including their site). I can do other stuff like integrate products into <a href=\"https://www.zalando.co.uk/women-home/\">Zolando</a> or replicate the design of almost any site.
